Instead of the original design where the user-selected  hourglass  is  shown  with a check  on  it  if  it  was  correct 
or  X  if incorrect on the EasyResult screen, we decided to implement a highlighted border that showed red on incorrect 
guesses and green on correct guesses, as this was easier to implement and more intuitive in our opinion.

We thought having six (or more) activities for this simple version of the app was a little overkill, and thought that
combining the results page could make the design easier to navigate and digest for the user. 

We tested whether the app displayed the correct results for each level (short, medium, long) in the easy learn activities
by implementing a highlighted border that showed red on incorrect guesses and green on correct guesses.
